# Receipt-Scanner
This github-repo will include a program that scans store-receipts, og logs the prices of items.
The concept is to snap a photo of the receipt; send it to a cloud server, where it's processed and logged. The plan is to track changes in prices of products if the user buys the item regulary. The user shall also be able to set a budget.
